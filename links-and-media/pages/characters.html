                    The half-human, half-alien leader of the Guardians who was abducted from Missouri as a child in 1988 
                    and raised by a group of alien thieves and smugglers called the Ravagers. About the character, Pratt said, 
                    "He had a hard time as a kid, and now he goes around space, making out with hot alien girls and just being 
                    a rogue and a bit of a jerk, and through teaming up with these guys, finds a higher purpose for himself." 
                    He also added that the character is a mix of Han Solo and Marty McFly.

            <p>
                An orphan from an alien world who seeks redemption for her past crimes. She was trained by Thanos to be his 
                personal assassin. Saldaña said that she became Gamora through make-up rather than computer-generated imagery (CGI) 
                or performance capture. On taking the role, Saldaña said, "I was just excited to be asked to join by James Gunn and 
                to also play someone green. I've been blue before [in Avatar]." Saldaña described Gamora as "... a warrior, she's 
                an assassin and she's very lethal, but what saves her is the same thing that can doom her. She has a sense of righteousness. 
                She's a very righteous individual."

                <p>
                    A genetically-engineered raccoon-based bounty hunter, mercenary, and master of weapons and battle tactics. Gunn worked 
                    with live raccoons to get the correct feel for the character, and to make sure it was "not a cartoon character", saying, "It's not Bugs 
                    Bunny in the middle of the Avengers, it's a real, little, somewhat mangled beast that's alone. There's no one else in the universe quite 
                    like him, he's been created by these guys to be a mean-ass fighting machine." Describing Rocket in relation to the rest of the Guardians, 
                    Cooper said, "I think Rocket is dynamic. He's the sort of Joe Pesci in Goodfellas guy." 
                    Before Cooper was cast, James Gunn said that it was a challenge 
                    finding a voice for Rocket, that he was looking for someone who could balance "the fast-talking speech patterns that Rocket has, but also 
                    can be funny, because he is really funny. But also has the heart that Rocket has. Because there are actually some pretty dramatic scenes 
                    with Rocket."

                <p>
                    A tree-like humanoid, he is the accomplice of Rocket. Diesel stated that he provided the voice and motion capture for Groot, after originally 
                    being in talks to star in a new Phase Three Marvel film. 
                    On the character, which Gunn based on his dog, Gunn said, "All the Guardians start out the movie as bastards—except Groot. He's an innocent. He's 
                    a hundred percent deadly and a hundred percent sweet. He's caught up in Rocket's life, really." Gunn added that the design and movement of Groot 
                    took "the better part of a year" to create. Gunn added, "The ways in which Vin Diesel says, 'I am Groot,' I am astounded.

                    A warrior who seeks to avenge his family's death at the hands of Ronan. On relating to the character, Bautista said, "I can just relate to Drax 
                    so much it's not even funny. Just the simple things that we have in common. Simple things like the tattoos, the tragedy—because, you know, I had a 
                    bit of tragedy in my life, as well. So it's really easy for me to pull from that." Bautista also said that there was "a lot of comic relief to Drax", 
                    but the character was not aware of it. Bautista stated that he did not do much preparation for the role, because "Luckily, for me, I'm a lifelong athlete 
                    and I adapted real quick."
