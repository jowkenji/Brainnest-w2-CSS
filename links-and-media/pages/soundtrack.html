                    Guardians of the Galaxy: Awesome Mix Vol. 1 (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) is the soundtrack album for the Marvel Studios film Guardians of the Galaxy. 
                    Featuring the songs present on Peter Quill's mixtape in the film, the album was released by Hollywood Records on July 29, 2014. 
                    A separate film score album, Guardians of the Galaxy (Original Score), composed by Tyler Bates, was also released by Hollywood Records on the same date, 
                    along with a deluxe version featuring both albums. The soundtrack album reached number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, becoming the first soundtrack 
                    album in history consisting entirely of previously released songs to top the chart.
                    The album topped the Billboard Top Soundtracks chart for 11 consecutive weeks and 16 weeks in total. As of April 2017, it has sold over 1.75 million copies 
                    in the United States alone, and has been certified Platinum by the RIAA. The album was the US's second best-selling soundtrack album of 2014.
